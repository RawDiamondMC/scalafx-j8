[ScalaFX][1] 15.0.1-R21 targets support of JavaFX 15. This release was tested to work with Java 11 and Java 15. This
release can be used with Scala 2.12, 2.13, and Scala 3.

Braking changes:

* [Issue #340][340] Make collections creation consistent with Scala collections 2.13 and Scala 3. The change impact
  cases when you create a ScalaFX collection from other collections. For instance, before `ObservableBuffer(1,2,3)`
  and `ObservableBuffer(Seq(1,2,3))` created collection of type `ObservableBuffer[Int]`, this lead to some ambiguities
  what the type of the collection should be. To make clear that you want to copy individual elements rather than the
  whole collection as a single element use `from` method. For instance, `ObservableBuffer.from(Seq(1,2,3))` will create
  collection of type `ObservableBuffer[Int]`. Now `ObservableBuffer(Seq(1,2,3))` will assume that you are passing only
  one element of type `Seq[Int]` so it will create collection of type `ObservableBuffer[Seq[Int]]`. This behaviour is
  consistent with the collection factory methods in Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.

  In other words, if you provide elements directly, use `ObservableBuffer(1,2,3)`. If you have elements in some other
  collection, say `mySeq` of type `Seq[Int]` and you want to create `ObservableBuffer` from its individual elements,
  use `ObservableBuffer.from(mySeq)`.
